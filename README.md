# ADHD Scripts

Just some scripts I wrote to try to automate some stuff that I find boring 

Wrote a few things in `applescript`, mainly just for opening finances, email, or time management pages. I converted the `.applescript` files into Applications, and then added cute little icons that I found. Eventually I'd like to set them up to launch at a certain time
